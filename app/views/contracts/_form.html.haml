        Eligibility
      %p
        I hereby certify that I am a “student” in good standing and am eligible to 

        rent and reside in BYU-Idaho approved housing. I have been admitted to 

        a track as a student at BYU-Idaho. Online-only and Continuing Education 

        students are not eligible for approved housing. I understand that I cannot 

        live in approved housing prior to my assigned semester start date or after 

        graduation. I recognize and understand that my certification of student 

        status and responsibility to maintain my student eligibility while attending 

        BYU-Idaho is material to and relied upon by Landlord in entering into this 

        rental agreement. I further certify that I am not registered as a sex offender. 

        Any misrepresentation found herein is grounds for immediate termination 

        of this rental agreement and such other legal and equitable remedies as 

        Landlord may pursue. (See section 5 for more information.)

        Living Standards
      %p
      I agree to comply with and acknowledge Landlord’s and my responsibility 

      to maintain the Apartment Living Standards as stated in the BYU-Idaho 

      Approved Housing Guidebook incorporated herein by reference. Students 

      are expected to help their guests and other residents understand and 

      maintain the BYU-Idaho Apartment Living Standards. Failure to meet these 

      expectations can be sufficient cause for termination of this Contract and 

      eviction.

        Parking Acknowledgement
      %p
        I know and understand that whether or not I own or operate a motor vehicle, 

        I am responsible to know the parking guidelines and requirements of the 

        housing property and abide by them. I also understand that I have a 

        responsibility to reasonably inform guests who visit my apartment of the 

        parking requirements. I understand that if I or any of my guests park illegally 

        (e.g., in a resident’s or handicapped stall for which I or my guest(s) do not 
        
        have a permit, outside of a designated stall, in a “no parking zone,” etc.), I 

        or my guest(s) accept the risk of being booted or towed.
